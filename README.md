# Introduction
Veterinary clinics face significant challenges when it comes to storing and finding patient data using physical folders. Maintaining accurate and organized records is crucial for providing the best care for patients, but the manual process of filing and retrieving paper records can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Physical folders can also take up valuable space and be vulnerable to damage or loss, making it difficult for clinics to ensure the confidentiality and security of sensitive patient information. Additionally, the manual nature of physical folders makes it challenging to quickly access patient information, especially when multiple staff members are involved in a patient's care. These difficulties can lead to decreased efficiency, longer wait times for patients, and potentially even harm to the animals being treated.

# Objective
The objective of creating a veterinary clinic patient management system is to address the challenges associated with storing and finding patient data using physical folders. This solution aims to automate the process of storing, retrieving, and organizing patient information, making it easier for clinics to provide high-quality care. The system provides a secure and centralized database for storing patient data, allowing staff members to quickly access the information they need from any location. By eliminating the need for manual filing and retrieval of paper records, the system can help clinics reduce errors, improve efficiency, and ensure the confidentiality and security of sensitive patient information. Additionally, the system can be configured to meet the unique needs of each clinic, making it a versatile solution for managing patient records in the veterinary field.
